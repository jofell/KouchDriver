	<p>Kohana currently has a CouchDB driver uploaded, but currently doesn't work and has a confusing set of source code, trying hard to have the ORM feel to every Model objects using it.</p>


	<p>PHP has the following libraries to connect to CouchDB</p>


	<ol>
	<li><a href="http://kore-nordmann.de/projects/phpillow/" class="external">PHPillow</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-object-freezer/tree" class="external">PHP Object_Freezer</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://github.com/dready92/PHP-on-Couch/tree/master" class="external">PHP On Couch</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.topdog.za.net/php_couchdb_extension" class="external">PHP CouchDB Extension</a></li>
	</ol>


	<p>The problem with using PHPillow and PHP Object Freezer is the bloat that they provide and the unnecessary saving-on-the-go for every attribute set on the object. Same goes on PHP On Couch. PHP CouchDB Extension, on the other hand is too anemic and not object-oriented enough to serve the purpose of Kohana.</p>


	<p>Thus, the Vibal Foundation made its own Kohana CouchDB driver based on one of these technologies, which is PHP On Couch. It's called <strong>KouchDriver</strong> (Annotation: In the future, this driver class will be changed to use native cURL to enhance performance and reduce object bloat. But future implementations will be based on the concepts presented below.)</p>


	<h2 id="Installation">Installation<a href="#Installation" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h2>


Currently, since it's not yet uploaded to the Kohana Main Site, but for the meantime, you can download the source code by checking out from the subversion server (<a href="http://svn.jofell.com/kouch-driver/trunk" class="external">http://svn.jofell.com/kouch-driver/trunk</a>) by invoking in the commandline:<br />
<pre>
svn co http://svn.jofell.com/kouch-driver/trunk/ KounchDriver
</pre>

	<p>Put all the files inside your `applications` folder of your Kohana install. That's it.</p>


	<h2 id="Usage">Usage<a href="#Usage" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h2>


	<h3 id="Setting-the-configuration">Setting the configuration<a href="#Setting-the-configuration" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


Before doing anything, configure your KouchDriver by editting the `kouchdb.conf` file inside your `config` folder. The sample file would give you the following:<br />
<pre>
    $config['default']    = array(
        'host'        =&gt; '192.168.4.31', // The host name or the server's IP address to connect to
        'port'        =&gt; 5984, // The CouchDB port number where the database is being hosted
        'database'    =&gt; 'blog', // The CouchDB database to work on
        'ssl'        =&gt; False // If the connection should be using SSL, not yet supported
    );
</pre>

As you can see, you can also add more database connections, by just adding another key from the `$config` variable, like so:<br />
<pre>
    $config['otherdb']    = array(
        'host'        =&gt; '192.168.4.31', // The host name or the server's IP address to connect to
        'port'        =&gt; 5984, // The CouchDB port number where the database is being hosted
        'database'    =&gt; 'blog', // The CouchDB database to work on
        'ssl'        =&gt; False // If the connection should be using SSL, not yet supported
    );
</pre>

	<p>We'll discuss later how connecting to other databases is done.</p>


	<h3 id="Creating-a-Model">Creating a Model<a href="#Creating-a-Model" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p>Unlike in any default Kohana installation, KouchDriver doesn't try to auto-create queries or auto-add objects the SQL way. It just treats each Kouchdbmodel subclasses as a router to views and create new documents based on its Model name.</p>


	<p>Inside the `models` folder, create a sample Model class called Users_Model which extends the Kouchdbmodel class.</p>


<pre>
class Users_Model extends Kouchdbmodel
{        
}
</pre>

	<h3 id="Adding-a-Document">Adding a Document<a href="#Adding-a-Document" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


To add a document, you just create a new instance of your model, and set your attributes, like so:<br />
<pre>
class Hello_Controller extends Controller 
{

    function add()
    {
        $users_model = new Users_Model();
        $users_model-&gt;firstname = 'Ivy Jean';
        $users_model-&gt;lastname = 'Vibar';
        $users_model-&gt;email = 'ivibar@vibalfoundation.org';
        $users_model-&gt;password = sha1('Ivy');
        $users_model-&gt;save();
        print_r($users_model);
    }

}
</pre>

	<p>The resulting CouchDB document will be like this:</p>


<pre>
{
   "_id": "users:12619907257372",
   "_rev": "1-9fcf2135a9fee51d2348286e7ecbadd1",
   "doctype": "users",
   "firstname": "Ivy Jean",
   "lastname": "Vibar",
   "email": "ivibar@vibalfoundation.org",
   "password": "f3742ddc65ddad911e4f7f284021686e152498d7" 
}
</pre>

	<p>If you noticed, the id is not typical CouchDB ID. And it also has a 'doctype' attribute that shouldn't be editted (Annotation: In the future, there will be protection for the doctype attribute). The ID is a combination of the doctype and the UNIX timestamp plus a random number. (Annotation: There will be ways in the future how to set the generation of keys, but for the meantime...)</p>


	<p>After the `$users_model->save()` method, the $users_model will be populated with data like the id and the doctype. Please take note that the idea of the ID here is past the colon of the actual document ID. To get the KouchDriver ID, you have to invoke `$users_model->docid()` method.</p>


If you want to save a document to another database connection other than the default, initialize the instance by doing so:<br />
<pre>
$users_model = new Users_Model(NULL, 'otherdb');
</pre>

	<h3 id="Retrieving-a-Document-by-ID-and-updating-it">Retrieving a Document by ID, and updating it<a href="#Retrieving-a-Document-by-ID-and-updating-it" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


You can retrieve a document by initializing the Model with an ID. You can do it like this:<br />
<pre>
$users_model = new Users_Model(12619907257372);
</pre>

You can access the properties by invoking its object properties like so:<br />
<pre>
echo $users_model-&gt;email;
echo $users_model-&gt;docid;
</pre>

You can also edit it by setting its properties, just like when adding:<br />
<pre>
$users_model-&gt;email = 'ijvibar@vibalfoundation.org';
$users_model-&gt;save();
</pre>

You can retrieve documents from other connections like so:<br />
<pre>
$users_model = new Users_Model(12619907257372, 'otherdb');
</pre>

	<h3 id="Deleting-a-document">Deleting a document<a href="#Deleting-a-document" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p>To delete a document using the doc id, instantiate an instance of the document like so:</p>


<pre>
$users_model = new Users_Model(12619907257372);
</pre>

	<p>... and then, invoke the "delete" instance method:</p>


<pre>
$users_model-&gt;delete();
</pre>

	<p><em>Under construction</em></p>


	<h3 id="Using-Views">Using Views<a href="#Using-Views" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p>KouchDriver doesn't try to create views or design documents inside the code. The authors of this driver believes that operations on the CouchDB database other than CRUD must stay in CouchDB.</p>


<blockquote>

	<p><strong>Some rules</strong></p>


</blockquote>

<blockquote>

	<ul>
	<li>It must be implied that if you name your model 'Users', your `doctype` should be 'users' (small case), and you have a design document named _design/users` catering for doctypes of type 'users' or relatwed documents (for CouchDB joins)</li>
		<li>Each views from the design document will have an automatic available method inside the model. If for example you have a `fullname` design document view, then any Users_Model instance will have a `fullname()` method that can be accessed. This method will return the collection of data retrieved by the view.</li>
		<li>The view methods can accept an associative array parameter which either limits the number or retrieved items, have a beginning / end keys, descending order, etc.</li>
	</ul>


</blockquote>

To demonstrate the power of this feature, assuming there's already a `fullname` view inside your design document `_design/users`, you can do the following:<br />
<pre>
class Hello_Controller extends Controller 
{

    function display()
    {
        $users_model = new Users_Model();
        $results = $users_model-&gt;fullname(
            array(
                'startkey' =&gt; 'users:12619805742643',
                'include_docs' =&gt; TRUE
                )
            );
        echo '&lt;pre&gt;';
        print_r($results);
        echo '&lt;/pre&gt;';
    }

}
</pre>

	<p>The parameters that could be used for this are the following:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>key</li>
		<li>keys</li>
		<li>startkey</li>
		<li>startkey_docid</li>
		<li>endkey</li>
		<li>endkey_docid</li>
		<li>limit</li>
		<li>stale</li>
		<li>descending</li>
		<li>skip</li>
		<li>group</li>
		<li>group_level</li>
		<li>reduce</li>
		<li>include_docs</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Accotding to the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_view_API" class="external">CouchDB HTTP Views API</a> page:</p>


<blockquote>

	<p>key, startkey, and endkey need to be properly JSON encoded values (for example, startkey="string" for a string value).</p>


	<p>A JSON structure of {"keys": ["key1", "key2", ...]} can be posted to any user defined view or _all_docs to retrieve just the view rows matching that set of keys. Rows are returned in the order of the keys specified. Combining this feature with include_docs=true results in the so-called multi-document-fetch feature.</p>


	<p>If you specify ?limit=0 you don't get any data, but all meta-data for this View. The number of documents in this View for example.</p>


	<p>The skip option should only be used with small values, as skipping a large range of documents this way is inefficient (it scans the index from the startkey and then skips N elements, but still needs to read all the index values to do that). For efficient paging you'll need to use startkey and limit. If you expect to have multiple documents emit identical keys, you'll need to use startkey_docid in addition to startkey to paginate correctly. The reason is that startkey alone will no longer be sufficient to uniquely identify a row.</p>


	<p>The stale option can be used for higher performance at the cost of possibly not seeing the all latest data. If you set the stale option to ok, CouchDB may not perform any refreshing on the view that may be necessary. Using this option essentially tells CouchDB that if a reference to the view index is available in memory (ie, if the view has been queried at least once since couch was started), go ahead and use it, even if it may be out of date. The result is that for a highly trafficked view, end users can see lower latency, although they may not get the latest data. However, if there is no view index pointer in memory, the behavior with this option is that same as the behavior without the option. If your application use stale=ok for end-user queries, you'll need either a cron or a notification process like the one described in Regenerating_views_on_update, which queries without stale=ok to ensure that the view is kept reasonably up to date.</p>


	<p>View rows are sorted by the key; specifying descending=true will reverse their order. Note that the descending option is applied before any key filtering, so you may need to swap the values of the startkey and endkey options to get the expected results. The sorting itself is described in ViewCollation.</p>


	<p>The group option controls whether the reduce function reduces to a set of distinct keys or to a single result row.</p>


	<p>If a view contains both a map and reduce function, querying that view will by default return the result of the reduce function. The result of the map function only may be retrieved by passing reduce=false as a query parameter.</p>


	<p>The include_docs option will include the associated document. Although, the user should keep in mind that there is a race condition when using this option. It is possible that between reading the view data and fetching the corresponding document that the document has changed. If you want to alleviate such concerns you should emit an object with a _rev attribute as in emit(key, {"_rev": doc._rev}). This alleviates the race condition but leaves the possiblity that the returned document has been deleted (in which case, it includes the "_deleted": true attribute).</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Make the base CouchDB library to be native PHP curl actions.</li>
		<li>Make the delete method static to the class so there'd be no need to instantiate the document.</li>
		<li>More robust views</li>
